Stork is a ROM hacking tool for Yoshi's Island DS. YIDS has an immensely powerful engine, while having the same charming graphics and platforming as the original, and a level editor was begging to be made for it. I had created one previously, but it was written in C++ and Qt, and was developed before I fully understood the file structure of YIDS. Rust provides a dramatically more stable framework, and is somehow faster as well.

The game version used is **USA 1.0**, please rip legally. Support for other versions is in progress
